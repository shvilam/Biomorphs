**Biomorphs**
=========

Javascript implementation of Richard Dawkins' famous Biomorphs.
more infor about Richard Dawkins' famous Biomorphs can be found [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=Biomorphs+can+be+found+here&oq=Biomorphs+can+be+found+here&aqs=chrome..69i57.340j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#q=biomorphs+richard+dawkins). 

## Using Git as DB
I have chose to save the stats of the diffrent Biomorph in git for easy way to diff the file.
I think that the 2 concept going together great becase both of them are for save inctermtal changes.
the intailse conceept was 
create branches for each run so when you will go over the commit it will make more seacne.

**The cons** of this nice idea is scalablity this implemention could not scale at all.
Maily becase the changes on the local file can run over each other and the git prosses can be lock by other prosses.

## What is missing 
There is few thing that are missing manliy becase it only written as a concept project and not a real one and as allway shortege of avalable time.
- test there is not implamention of Unit test or any other test at all 
- no error handling
