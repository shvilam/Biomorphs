{"name":"Biomorphs","tagline":"JS implementation of Richard Dawkins' Biomorphs Using git as DB","body":"**Biomorphs**\r\n=========\r\n\r\nJavascript implementation of Richard Dawkins' famous Biomorphs. \r\nMore info about Richard Dawkins' famous Biomorphs can be found here. [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=Biomorphs+can+be+found+here&oq=Biomorphs+can+be+found+here&aqs=chrome..69i57.340j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#q=biomorphs+richard+dawkins). \r\n\r\nMy Colorful implementation\r\n![ScreenShot](/ScreenShot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technologies Using\r\n\r\nClient Side\r\n- Javascript\r\n- Canavs \r\n- jquriy\r\n- History.js https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/\r\n\r\nSerever\r\n- nodejs\r\n- express\r\n- nodegit http://www.nodegit.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rquriments** \r\n\r\nApart form the obvious ones. You will have to create a git repository one level up from your server folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n## Using Git as DB\r\nI have chosen to save the stats of the different Biomorph in git for easy way to diff the file.\r\nI think that the 2 concept going together great because both of them are build to save incremental changes.\r\nthe intailse concept was\r\ncreated branches for each run so when you will go over the commit it will make more scene.\r\n\r\n**The cons** of this nice idea is scalability this implementation could not scale at all.\r\nMainly because the changes on the local file can run over each other and the git process can be locked by other processes.\r\n\r\n## Solving the scalablity issue \r\nIt can be solve some quite easily with using sql base db, like mysql each Biomorph will have a key and each Biomorph will be have it own row.\r\nIt can even scale it using nosql db like mongo.\r\n\r\nBoth changes could be done quite easily.\r\n\r\n## What is missing \r\nThere is few thing that are missing mainly because it only written as a concept project and not a real one and as always shortage of time.\r\n- test there is not implementation of Unit test or any other test at all. \r\n- no error handling \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-49309184-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
